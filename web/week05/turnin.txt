After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Project Title / One sentence descpription:
PHP Database Access / Read-only access to database and ability to search through the data.

2. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:
https://powerful-escarpment-35883.herokuapp.com/week05/data.php

3. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/ChaseTJacobs/cs313/tree/master/web/week05

4. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
This application has a drop down box that you can use to search the database. Each option in the drop down box is a number range for prices, and when you hit search, the results will only be the items which prices fall within that range.

5. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
It doesn't look very pretty

6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
D - Meets requirements

7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
The basic requirements are met, but setting up the PostreSQL Database with Heroku took forever, more than actually figuring out how to access the database with PHP. I am quite proud of my search function though.
